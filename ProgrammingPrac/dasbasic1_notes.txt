Data Structures are different ways of storing data that can be used effectively
Alag alag data ko store karne ke treeke taki ham data ko asaani se fetch aur modify kar sake

algorith step by step treeka hota hai kisi bhi problem ko solve karne ka

what makes a good algorithm?
1.Correctness
2.Efficiency

DSA kyu important hai
to make process efficient ham dsa use krte hai
if data is organized we can easily perform task on it efficiently

Types of data structures
primitive:int float char boolean

non primitive:derieved from primitive
linear  
  static array
  dynamic LL,stack,queue
non linear 
  tree
  graph


Types of algorithms
recursive
Divide and conquer algorithms eg quick and merge sort

Dynamic Programming Algorithm
it work based on memoization
to find the best solution

Greedy algorithm
we find the best
it work in phases 
we hope that by choosing a locl optimal solution at each step we will end up at global optimal solution

BruteForce algorithm
tries all options/possibilities untill a possible solution is received


Randomized algorithm
uses random numbr atleast once during the computation to complete the probem
